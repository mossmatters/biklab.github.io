# Abstract

Although our understanding of microbial eukaryote taxa is already being transformed by high-throughput sequencing approaches, the research community is keenly aware of the looming computational challenges and pressing need to integrate disparate, complementary, data types such as taxonomy, morphology, and functional knowledge.
