# Abstract

Microscopic eukaryotes are abundant, diverse and fill critical ecological roles across every ecosystem on Earth, yet there is a well-recognized gap in understanding of their global biodiversity. Fundamental advances in DNA sequencing and bioinformatics now allow accurate en masse biodiversity assessments of microscopic eukar- yotes from environmental samples. Despite a promising outlook, the field of eukaryotic marker gene surveys faces significant challenges: how to generate data that are most useful to the community, especially in the face of evolving sequencing technologies and bioinformatics pipelines, and how to incorporate an expanding number of target genes.
