# Abstract

There is a huge disparity across the phylum Nematoda in terms of our molecular knowledge. For some species, such as the parasitic Brugia malayi, we possess complete genome sequences (both nuclear and mitochondrial) as well as detailed information about life history, reproduction and relationships with symbionts. For countless other species (especially free-living species from marine environments) not even a single published gene sequence exists. For a phylum with an insurmountable taxonomic deficit, molecular methods offer cheap, quick and non-specialist ways to investigate biodiversity and speciation. Unsurprisingly, such methods are now revolutionizing our understanding of nematode evolution and biogeography.
