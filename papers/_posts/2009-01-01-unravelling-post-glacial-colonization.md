# Abstract

The profusion of recent phylogeographical studies is linked to the increasing ease and ubiquity of molecular methods. Phylogeography itself is concerned primarily with assessing intraspecific variation between populations in order to deduce processes influencing the spatial distribution of genealogical lineages. In practice, this usually involves analysing molecular diversity by defining the haplotypes present in a population â€“ variants of a specified gene, assigned according to the exact positions of nucleotide polymorphisms in the gene sequence. Such techniques have increasingly been applied to shed light on the historic routes of post-glacial colonization in European species.
