# Abstract

Metagenomic sequencing now represents a common, powerful approach for investigating diversity and functional relationships in marine ecosystems. High- throughput datasets generated from random fragments of environmental DNA can provide a less biased view of organismal abundance (versus PCR-based amplicon se- quencing) and enable novel exploration of microbial ge- nomes by recovering genome assemblies from uncultured species, identifying ecological functions, and reconstructing metabolic pathways. This review highlights the current state of knowledge in marine metagenomics, focusing on biolog- ical insights gained from recent environmental studies and detailing commonly employed methods for data collection and analysis.
