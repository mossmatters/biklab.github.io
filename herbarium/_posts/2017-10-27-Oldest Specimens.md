What is the oldest specimen in the E.L. Reed Hebarium? This humble looking specimen of *Stevia salificolia* was collected in 1885 in Chiuhuaha, Mexico by [Cyrus Pringle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_Pringle). The herbarium at the University of Vermont is named after Pringle, who is known for his cross-bred potatoes (though apparently not related to the potato chip brand of the same name0. According [to the UVM website](https://www.uvm.edu/~plantbio/pringle/Life%20of%20Cyrus%20Guernsey%20Pringle.html), this specimen would have been from Pringle's first trip to Mexico.

*Stevia* is the plant from which the sweetner of the same name is extracted, though usually from a different species *Stevia rebaudiana*. It is reported that the leaves of *Stevia* are sweet as sugar, but it is not advisable to taste this herbarium specimen, which likely was treated with Mercuric chloride.
