# Assembling Plant Presses

The Herbarium teamed up with [Dylan Scwhilk](http://schwilk.org/) to assemble plant presses for Dr. Scwhilk's majors-level botany class at Texas Tech. Each press uses about 30 feet of "doorstop wood" purchased locally. We were able to assemble 21 presses in about 6 hours!
