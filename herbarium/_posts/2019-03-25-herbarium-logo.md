# New Herbarium Logo

![](/assets/images/herbarium/ReedHerbarium_Logo.png){:class="img-responsive"}

We're pleased to introduce a new logo for the E.L. Reed Herbarium! The logo was designed by lab technician and Biology TTU Graduate School Alumna [Haley Hale]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link team/_posts/2018-09-01-haley-hale.md %}). The logo depitcts three grasses, _Panicum virgatum_ (switchgrass), _Bouteloua curtipendula_ (sideoats grama) and _Bouteloa gracilis_ (blue grama), to represent the rich diversity of native grasses in the South Plains and Llano Estacado regions. The Reed Herbarium has a large collection of grasses from the region, many of which have been digitized in our online Texas-Oklahoma Regional Consortium of Herbaria (TORCH) portal. 

The new logo is part of our continuing efforts to raise awareness of the importance of collections to natural history and botanical research in the 21st century.
