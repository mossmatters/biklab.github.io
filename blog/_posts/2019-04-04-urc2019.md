# Lab Presentations at TTU URC 2019

Each year, the [Center for Transformative Undergraduate Experience](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/true/ConferenceHome/index.php) hosts a three-day event showcasing undergraduate research. Two lab members-- Madeline Slimp (TTU Honors '21) and Zach Bailey (TTU Honors '19)-- presented posters this year. 

Both of their projects make use of herbarium specimens from our collection of plants of Guadalupe Mountains National Park. The collection was made in the early 1970s, and provides a botanical snapshot of the community.

Congrats to Zach and Madeline, and thanks for representing the lab and the herbarium!
