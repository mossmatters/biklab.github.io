# Botany 2020

![](/assets/images/blog/botany2020flyer.jpg){:class="img-responsive"} <br> *Johnson Lab Talksat Botany 2020.*

The highlight of the year for us is always the Botany conference, which is being held virtually this year. While we are sad to miss out on Alaska, the online setting means our lab has our highest participation yet, with *eight* talks!

-  Undergraduate Madeline Slimp will be giving an overview of work we're doing in the E.L. Reed Herbarium using 2000+ specimens collected in Guadalupe Mountains National Park made when it opened in the 1970s. Conservation genomics, stomatal density, metagenomis, and more!
-  Lab Manager Haley Hale, will be describing our experience bringing research into our undergraduate Botany lab, where students used Angiosperms353 in the lab and on the computer to build phylogenies using herbarium specimens.
-  PI Matt Johnson, was invited to participate in a symposium on Angiosperms353, organized by [Rachel Jabaily](https://www.coloradocollege.edu/academics/dept/obe/people/profile.html?person=jabaily_rachel_schmidt) and [Laura Lagomarsino](http://www.lauralago.net/).
- Undergraduate Cassidy Coker will be describing her efforts to extract fungal DNA from plant herbarium specimens, and to use metabarcoding techniques to identify how the fungal microbiome differs between leaf and root tissues.
-  Ph.D. student Yanni Chen will be speaking about applications of phylogenomics to restoration ecology. How has the gene KAI2, a germination gene that interacts with smoke, influenced the evolution of the smoke response in seeds?
- Master's student Aman Pruthi will be talking about our early efforts to sequence the genome of _Bryum argenteum_, which he will be using to help charactarize the evolution of small RNA in bryophytes.
- Ph.D. Student Lindsay Williams will be describing our workflow for extracting population genomics data from HybSeq in using sequences from the moss _Physcomitrium pyriforme_. Are there cryptic species hidden within this widespread moss?
- Master's student Kira Buckowing will be presenting on our progress expanding the phylotranscriptomic analysis of pleurocarpous mosses-- is the large expansion in gene families due to whole genome duplication?
