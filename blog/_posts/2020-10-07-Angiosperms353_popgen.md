# Angiosperms353 PopGen

Our lab has a new preprint, "On the potential of Angiosperms353 for Population Genomics." The paper is the first for undergraduate (and first author!) [Madeline Slimp]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link team/_posts/2018-02-14-madeline-slimp.md %}) and Ph.D. Student [Lindsay Williams](({{ site.baseurl }}{% link team/_posts/2020-01-03-Lindsay-Williams.md %})). It is also the first empirical paper entirely produced by our lab at Texas Tech! 

Some highlights include:

- Successful low-cost library preparation from 50-year-old herbarium specimens.
- High recovery rate of Angiosperms353 genes from 24 species.
- Adapted data workflows to call SNPs within species from HybSeq data.
- Substantial genetic diversity within all species.
