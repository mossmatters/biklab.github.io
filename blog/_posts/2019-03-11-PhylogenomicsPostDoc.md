We are hiring a Post-Doctoral Research Associate with expertise in Phylogenomics and Bioinformatics. The post-doc will work as part of a three-university [NSF-funded collaboration](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1753800&HistoricalAwards=false) to investigate the phylogeography and ploidal diversity of the moss [*Physcomitrium pyriforme*](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/physcohunt) using targeted sequence capture. More information about the project can be found at [funariaceae.uconn.edu](funariaceae.uconn.edu) 


### Required Qualifications 
* Ph.D. in Biology, Bioinformatics, Computer Science, or Related Field at time of start date
* 2-3 years programming experience (C++, Java, Python, R or similar)
* Fluency in English (oral and written)

### Major/Essential Functions
* Analysis of next-generation sequence data using high-throughput methods.
* Adapting existing bioinformatics tools for species delimitation and population genomics of non-model, polyploid organisms.
* Designing novel phylogenomics packages to efficiently process target capture data.
* Working with the research team to write peer-reviewed manuscripts and conference presentations.
* Organizing a bioinformatics workshop to train researchers in target capture methods.
* Mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students.


### Preferred candidates will have experience in one or more of the following:
* Design and deployment of open source bioinformatics packages.
* Data analysis (Jupyter/Pandas/R) and version control (Git).
* Design and implementation of SQL and other relational databases.
* Web design and interface with online databases.
* Phylogenomics analysis software (MAFFT, RAxML, ASTRAL).
* Evolution and biology of plants, including bryophytes.
