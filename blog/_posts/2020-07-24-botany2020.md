# Botany 2020

![](/assets/images/blog/botany2020flyer.jpg){:class="img-responsive"} <br> *Johnson Lab Talksat Botany 2020.*

The highlight of the year for us is always the Botany conference, which is being held virtually this year. While we are sad to miss out on Alaska, the online setting means our lab has our highest participation yet, with *eight* talks! 

-  **"Herbaria as botanical snapshots: 50 years of land use and climate change impacts on genetics and physiology in the Guadalupe Mountains"** Undergraduate [Madeline Slimp](https://twitter.com/madelineslimp) will be giving an overview of work we're doing in the E.L. Reed Herbarium using 2000+ specimens collected in Guadalupe Mountains National Park made when it opened in the 1970s. Conservation genomics, stomatal density, metagenomis, and more! Abstract #353, July 27 at 10:30 AM.
-  **"Implementing undergraduate research in an upper-level botany lab using target capture sequencing of herbarium specimens"** Lab Manager [Haley Hale](https://twitter.com/thehaleofit), will be describing our experience bringing research into our undergraduate Botany lab, where students used Angiosperms353 in the lab and on the computer to build phylogenies using herbarium specimens. Abstract #477, July 29 at 12:30 PM.
-  **"On the potential of Angiosperms353 for population genomics."** PI [Matt Johnson](https://twitter.com/mossmatters), was invited to participate in a symposium on Angiosperms353, organized by [Rachel Jabaily](https://www.coloradocollege.edu/academics/dept/obe/people/profile.html?person=jabaily_rachel_schmidt) and [Laura Lagomarsino](http://www.lauralago.net/), and will be describing preliminary analysis of Angiosperms353 data at and below the species level. Abstract #263, July 29 at 1:30 PM.
- **"Characterization of the Fungal Microbiome in 50-Year-Old Plant Herbarium Specimens"** Undergraduate Cassidy Coker will be describing her efforts to extract fungal DNA from plant herbarium specimens, and to use metabarcoding techniques to identify how the fungal microbiome differs between leaf and root tissues. Lightning Talk Abstract #336 July 31 at 10:50 AM.
- **"Methods to Delimit Speciation and Determine Population Parameters of the Moss, Physcomitrium pyriforme Using Target Capture Sequencing"** Ph.D. Student [Lindsay Williams](https://twitter.com/lindsawi) will be describing our workflow for extracting population genomics data from HybSeq in using sequences from the moss _Physcomitrium pyriforme_. Are there cryptic species hidden within this widespread moss? Lightning Talk Abstract #400 July 31 at 11:20 AM.
- **"Development of genomic tools for Bryum argenteum: Applications in small RNA and population genetics"** Master's student [Aman Pruthi](https://twitter.com/Aman_Pruthi_) will be talking about our early efforts to sequence the genome of _Bryum argenteum_, which he will be using to help charactarize the evolution of small RNA in bryophytes. Lightning Talk Abstract #419 July 31 at 11:25 AM.
-  **"Phylogenomics and Habitat Restoration: Detecting the Effects of Gene Duplication and Diversification of KAI2 on Seed Germination"** Ph.D. student Yanni Chen will be speaking about applications of phylogenomics to restoration ecology. How has the gene KAI2, a germination gene that interacts with smoke, influenced the evolution of the smoke response in seeds? Lightning Talk Abstract #420 July 31 at 11:30 AM.
- **"Expanded phylotranscriptomic sampling reveals gene family expansion in pleurocarpous mosses"** Master's student Kira Buckowing will be presenting on our progress expanding the phylotranscriptomic analysis of pleurocarpous mosses-- is the large expansion in gene families due to whole genome duplication? Lightning Talk Abstract #523 July 31 at 12:45 PM.
