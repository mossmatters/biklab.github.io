# Johnson Lab Code of Conduct
_Last Revision: August 1, 2018_

The Johnson lab values participation of every member of our community, and we want to ensure that every contributor has an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. 
The Johnson Lab community is defined as everyone who participates in any Johnson Lab project, including undergraduates, graduate students, technicians, post-docs, collaborators, and lab visitors. **Members of the community are expected to show courtesy to other community members at all times.**

Matt Johnson, as head of the Johnson Lab, and all lab members, are dedicated to a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, veteran status, or religion. **Harassment within our community is unacceptable in any form, and will not be tolerated.**

As a lab funded in part by the National Science Foundation (NSF), we are required to establish and maintain clear and unambiguous standards of behavior to ensure harassment-free workplaces. **Failure to comply with these directives can lead to suspension or termination of lab funding.**

The code of conduct applies wherever science is conducted, including research facilities, lab meetings, field sites, conferences and workshops:

- All communication, online and in person, should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at any time.

- Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other community members. Work to create an environment of open and collaborative learning.

- Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate. 

- Make an effort to make an inclusive environment for everyone. Give everyone a chance to talk and an opportunity to contribute.

- Watch out for [microagressions](https://advancingjustice-la.org/sites/default/files/ELAMICRO%20A_Guide_to_Responding_to_Microaggressions.pdf). Be aware that your actions can be hurtful to others and contribute to a negative environment even if you had no intent of harm. 

- Community members may address harassing and discriminatory behavior directly, whenever it occurs.

- Listen and offer genuine apologies. Commit to learning and doing better.

Unacceptable behavior includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, veteran status, or religion; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of discussions; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing or discriminatory behavior are expected to comply immediately, regardless of who is asking for the behavior to stop. If inappropriate behavior persists after discussion among concerned individuals, the contributor will be asked to discontinue their participation in Johnson Lab activities. 

Individuals experiencing harassment or discriminatory behavior are encouraged to contact Matt Johnson. Community members should be aware that all university faculty, staff, and student employees are mandatory reporters of sexual misconduct. Under Title IX, mandatory reporters who are either the subject of, witness to, or receive a report of gender-based harassment, discrimination, or sexual misconduct, including sexual harassment, sexual violence, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking, have the obligation to report such information to the Title IX office by filing a report at [http://www.depts.ttu.edu/titleix]()

Concerned individuals may also make reports directly to the Texas Tech Division of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion or the Office of the Dean of Students. 
If you need immediate assistance, do not hesitate to call Texas Tech Police at 806-742-2000 or 911.
