Bella is a 12 year old corgi-border collie mix and one of the two unofficial lab mascots. Well, we say corgi-border collie, but when we ran her genetics panel, the results were mutt all the way, with maybe some chow as a grandparent. Bella enjoys sleeping, eating, going on walks, and chasing rabbits.
