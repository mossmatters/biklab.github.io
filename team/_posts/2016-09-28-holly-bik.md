Dr. Holly Bik is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Nematology at the University of California-Riverside. She obtained her Ph.D. in molecular phylogenetics at University of Southampton, UK (working with John Lambshead at the Natural History Museum, London, in conjunction with the UK National Oceanography Center). She completed postdoctoral appointments with [Kelley Thomas] at the University of New Hampshire and [Jonathan Eisen] at the University of California--Davis. In 2014 she was awarded a Bioinformatics Fellowship at the University of Birmingham, UK. 

Research in the Bik Lab uses environmental DNA sequencing and computational biology tools to explore the biodiversity, evolution, and phylogeography of microbial eukaryote species in diverse habitats, with an emphasis on free-living marine nematodes and deep-sea ecosystems. Further details of research areas and ongoing projects can be found under the [Research] tab.

Aside from research, Holly is heavily involved in science communication and social media, serving as Associate Editor for the popular marine blog [Deep-Sea News] and maintaining an active presence on Twitter ([@hollybik]). She has co-authored a number of peer-reviewed articles on the use of social media and online tools in academia, including "[An Introduction to Social Media for Scientists]" in PLoS Biology and "[Ten Simple Rules for Effective Online Outreach]" in PLoS Computational Biology.
