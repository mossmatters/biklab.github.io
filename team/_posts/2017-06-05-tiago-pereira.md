Tiago is a molecular biologist and ecologist broadly interested in the study of marine meiofauna, particularly free-living nematodes. Previously, he worked with benthic meio-and macrofaunal organisms, mostly using them as bioindicators to access environmental disturbance in diverse marine/estuarine ecosystems. For his PhD, Tiago studied systematics and phylogenetics of soil and plant-parasitic nematodes, while maintaining a strong interest in marine biology/ecology. After completing his PhD, Tiago worked as postdoctorate researcher in the Baldwin Lab at UC Riverside on a project focused on using rapid methods (i.e. reverse taxonomy and metagenetics) to characterize soil nematode diversity in desert habitats. His current research in the Bik Lab focuses on patterns of diversity of meiofauna, especially free-living nematodes, in marine sediments from a variety of geographic regions (e.g. Alaskan Arctic, Gulf of Mexico, Gulf of California). This research integrates classical taxonomy (i.e. morphology-based) and molecular approaches (i.e. single individual DNA barcode and Illumina sequencing) as well as computational analysis of high-throughput sequencing datasets (i.e. metagenome assembly/annotation, ecological/statistical analyses of environmental RNA amplicons).
