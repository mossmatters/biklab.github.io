## NSF Reserach Coordination Network EukHiTS

RCN EukHiTS (Eukaryotic biodiversity research using <b>Hi</b>gh-Throughput Sequencing) is a collaborative project between the University of New Hampshire and the University of California, Davis, funded by a Research Coordination Network award from the National Science Foundation.

Microscopic eukaryote species (organisms <1mm, such as nematodes, fungi, protists, etc.) are abundant and ubiquitous, yet invisible to the naked eye, in every ecosystem on earth. The biodiversity and geographic distributions for most of these species are largely unknown, and represent one of the major knowledge gaps in biology. High-throughput DNA sequencing technologies now allow for deep examination of virtually all microscopic organisms present in an environmental sample. For microbial eukaryote taxa, en masse biodiversity assessment using traditional loci (rRNA genes) can be conducted at a fraction of the time and cost required for traditional (morphological) approaches. Despite this promise, current bottlenecks include the lack of useful distributed tools for analysis and common data standards to allow global comparisons across individual studies as well as missing links between molecules and morphology. RCN EukHiTS is focusing on developing community capabilities for computational approaches focused on eukaryotic taxa and the infrastructure, both cyber and human, needed for effective interpretation of large high-throughput datasets. The steering committee of RCN EukHiTS includes expertise from computational biology, functional genomics, computer science, taxonomy, ecology, database resource management, and representatives of end user communities to ensure that all aspects of the community are well-represented.

This NSF RCN builds on two previous community meetings organized my myself and Kelly Thomas: a 2014 SMBE Satellite Meeting on Eukaryotic -Omics and a 2011 NESCent Catalysis Meeting on “High-Throughput Biodiversity Assessment using Eukaryotic Metagenetics”.
