## PressForward (External Collaboration)

[PressForward] is a software tool that enables curation and sharing of content from around the internet. This free wordpress plugin works to collect inforation via an RSS feed reeder and browser bookmarklet, amalgamating, republishing and sharing content in one central location (typically via blog feed). The PressForward project is being led Stephanie Westcott at the [Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media] at George Mason University. 

As a PressForward Pilot Partner, we have guided the installation of this software tool on the [microBEnet] and [Deep-Sea Biology Society] websites, and helped build a team of community editors to review and disseminate content on a daily basis. Our goal as a Pilot Partner is to reduce the manual effort required for website administration (minimizing the administrative burden for scientists maintainting project websites), and to aggregate and share content in a way that is not currently possible with the default Wordpress backend.
