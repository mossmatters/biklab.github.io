This project aims to produce a new web-based scientific visualization framework for the analysis of high-throughput biological sequence data (initially focusing on rRNA amplicon data, but eventually extending to general biological sample by observation contingency tables). This work is a collaboration between UC Davis and Pitch Interactive (a data visualization studio based in Berkeley, CA). We aim to produce intuitive, interactive visualization tools that can be used to explore and analyze microbial community patterns in large environmental datasets (Illumina/454).  This project is taking advantage of standard file formats from computational pipelines (e.g. BIOM tables) in order to bridge the gap between biological software (e.g. QIIME) and existing data visualization capabilities (harnessing the flexibility and scalability of tools such as WebGL and HTML5). As project PI, I am responsible for defining biological questions that drive visualization needs, working closely with Pitch Interactive on data parsing frameworks and user interface design, and liaising with prospective end-users in the biological research community for feedback and feature requests. The funded grant proposal for this project has been posted to Figshare.
