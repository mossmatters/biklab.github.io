## microBEnet (External Collaboration)

[microBEnet] (Microbiology of the Built Environment Network) is the online destination for resources related to the microbiology of the built environment.  Funded by a grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation to Jonathan Eisen at the University of California, Davis, this project is a collaboration between the Eisen Lab and Hal Levin at the Building Ecology Research Group.  microBEnet focuses on three main categories of tasks, including 1) organizing meetings and workshops, 2) leveraging social media to facilitate communication and collaboration, 3) curation and creation of online resources to facilitate work in the Built Environment and to build a culture of openness and sharing. I am involved with curating online resources and social media tools for microBEnet, as well as providing bioinformatics oversight and design advice for microBEnetâ€™s citizen science and undergraduate research projects.
