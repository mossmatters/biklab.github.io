## microBEnet (External Collaboration)

[microBEnet] (the Microbiology of the Built Environment Network - http://www.microbe.net) is an online portal for resources related to the microbiology of the built environment. This project is led and maintained by [Jonathan Eisen's lab] at the University of California, Davis, and funded by a grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. The microBEnet project has historically focused on three main categories of tasks, including 1) organizing meetings and workshops, 2) leveraging social media to facilitate communication and collaboration, 3) curating and creating online resources to facilitate work in the Built Environment and to build a culture of openness and sharing. PI Holly Bik has been involved with curating online resources and social media tools for microBEnet, as well as providing bioinformatics oversight and design advice for microBEnetâ€™s citizen science and undergraduate research projects.
