## Genomic baseline surveys of Arctic meiofauna

This project is a collaboration with [Sarah Hardy] at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, funded through an award from the [North Pacific Research Board]. This research focuses on a set of >100 marine sediment samples colleted from two ocean regions (the Beaufort and Chuckchi Seas) off the north slope of Alaska. We are collecting and comparing three types of independent datasets: 1) Morphological taxonomy data from nematode communities, 2) Enviromental marker gene amplicons (16S and 18S rRNA) to broadly examine bacteria, archaea, and microbial eukaryote communities, and 3) Shotgun metagenomic data as a "PCR-free" approach for describing microbial community assemblages. Our goal is to compare biological insights gained from traditional taxonomy vs. high-thrughput genomic datasets, and to assess meiofaunal community diversity and phylogeographic patterns in understudied Arctic regions.
