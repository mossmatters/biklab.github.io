## Genomic baseline surveys of Arctic meiofauna

This project is applying high-throughput DNA sequencing techniques in the study of meiofaunal communities in the Arctic. The work is funded by the North Pacific Research Board, and represents a collaboration between UC Davis and the University of Alaska, Fairbanks (led by PI Sarah Hardy and Co-PI Arny Blanchard). Marker gene (18S rRNA) and metagenomic sequencing will be carried out alongside standard microscopic approaches and morphological taxonomy. Data will be used to assess meiofaunal community structure and diversity in the US Arctic (benthic habitats in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas), and identify possible environmental drivers of community structure. As Co-PI, I will be working closely with graduate students at the University of Alaska to generate Illumina datasets and carry out bioinformatic analyses.
