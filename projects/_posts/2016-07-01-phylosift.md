## PhyloSift (External Collaboration)

PhyloSift is a software pipeline for phylogenetic analysis of genomes and metagenomes. Using any biological sequence as input data (nucleotide or amino acid), PhyloSift uses a reference database of profile HMMs to identify candidate sequences matching phylogenetically-informative marker genes. Candidate sequences identified from input data are then subjected to phylogenetic placement approaches, where short reads are inserted into reference phylogenies and given taxonomic assignments based on this tree placement.  I have been actively involved with the development and documentation of PhyloSift. Software download and extensive documentation are available on the main PhyloSift website, and the code is maintained as an open source repository on Github.
