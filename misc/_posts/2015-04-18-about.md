# About this website

Our site is a fork of [Holly Bik]'s website, based on the amazing open source design templates developed by the labs of [D. Allan Drummond] and [Trevor Bedford]. We are forever indebted Allan and Trevor for allowing reuse of their codebase. 

This website is deployed using [TO BE DETERMINED] and the source code is available on [GitHub]. Please feel free to reuse this code (making sure to cite the Bedford lab and Drummond lab as the original sources of the lab website template).

Many thanks to [Taruna Aggarwal], bioinformagician in the Bik Lab who spearheaded the initial website setup and customization (and spent countless hours reverting commits and addressing many, many bug fixes).
