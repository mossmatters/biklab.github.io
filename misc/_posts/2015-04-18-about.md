# Our site's inspirations

Our site is based on the amazing open source design templates developed by the labs of [Trevor Bedford] and [D. Allan Drummond]. We are forever indebted to Trevor and Allan for allowing reuse of their codebase. Our site is deployed using [GitHub Pages] and the source code is available on [GitHub]. Please feel free to reuse this code (making sure to cite the Bedford lab and Drummond lab as the original sources of the lab website template).

Many thanks to [Taruna Aggarwal], bioinformagician in the Bik Lab who spearheaded the initial website setup and customization (and spent countless hours reverting commits and addressing many, many bug fixes).
