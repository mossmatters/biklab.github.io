# About this website

Our site is based on the amazing open source design templates developed by the labs of [D. Allan Drummond] and [Trevor Bedford]. We are forever indebted Allan and Trevor for allowing reuse of their codebase. As Jekyll newbies, we forked the Drummond lab repository and worked from the extensive templates, and somehow cobbled together a functional lab website in the end. The process was painful but ultimately rewarding, and we learned A LOT about Jekyll and Sass stylesheets in the process (although admittidly the learning curve is still high - our lab motto is "trial by fire").

Our site is deployed using [GitHub Pages] and the source code is available on [GitHub]. Please feel free to reuse this code (making sure to cite the Bedford lab and Drummond lab as the original sources of the lab website template).

Many thanks to [Taruna Aggarwal], bioinformagician in the Bik Lab who spearheaded the initial website setup and customization (and spent countless hours reverting commits and addressing many, many bug fixes).
