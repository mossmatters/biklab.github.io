We are interested in the **biodiversity**, **evolution**, and **phylogeography** of microbial eukaryotes in marine sediments, with an emphasis on **free-living marine nematodes** and **deep-sea ecosystems**. Our work aims to link **taxonomy** and **high-throughput sequencing** methods, using a combination of morphological and molecular approaches (marker gene amplicons, metagenomics, and targeted genome sequencing).

Our research **stands at the interface between biology and computer science**, using biological questions and evolutionary hypotheses to drive the development and refinement of â€“Omic approaches focused on microbial eukaryotes.
