The Johnson Lab at Texas Tech University is focused on plant phylogenomics-- using the relationships among species to reveal the evolution of plant genomes. Our research is aimed at one of the central questions of biology: **what forces drive the origin and maintenance of biodiversity?**

As the name of the site implies, a lot of our work has been on bryophytes. However, we welcome projects covering all aspects of plant systematics, genomics, and evolution. For more information about research conducted in the Johnson lab, please see our [Projects](/projects) page. 

Our research frequently involves the adaptation of bioinformatics tools to address questions in non-model organisms. Our work includes <a href="http://github.com/mossmatters/hybpiper">HybPiper</a>, a pipeline for processing targeted sequence data for phylogenetics, and <a href="http://githum.com/mossmatters/phyloscripts/phypartspiecharts">PhyPartsPieCharts</a>, a data visualization tool for bipartition analysis in phylogenomic data.
